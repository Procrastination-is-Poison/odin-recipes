TOP#1: HTML &amp; CSS
Recipe website with a main index page that has links to 3 separate recipe pages

PERSONAL REFLECTION PART I 
   HTML portion:
     Organized website folder according to conventional file organization system:
         separate index page, separate folder for remaining website pages, separate folder for images.

     Practiced nesting lists

     Practiced relative & absolute links. Remembered to add _blank target value to external links so they open in new tab. Put links in a list. Googled how to link to the top of a page (#top) which wasn't in html lessons. Also googled how to link to different sections of the same page using the global "id" attribute & "#". Needed it for glossary.html exercise where I organized a medical glossary by alphabetical order.

     Practiced inserting images. Fiddled with width/height attributes. Results not very pretty. Need to address with CSS elements.

     Spent too much time choosing images/icons to use & trying to manipulate them to align how I want. Will be using/addressing them with CSS.
     I'm afraid of ending up going down a design rabbit hole....

     Had to google how to insert a line between sections <hr>
REFLECTIONS ON GIT:
    Have been staging/doing commits using the integrated CL. Could probably use feedback on whether commits are appropriate/up to standards.
